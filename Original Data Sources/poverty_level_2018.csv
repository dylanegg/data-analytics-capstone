Notes,,
The American Community Survey did not release the 1-year estimates for 2020 due to significant disruptions to data collection brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. For 2020 data please refer to the [Distribution of Total Population by Federal Poverty Level (CPS)](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/distribution-of-total-population-by-federal-poverty-level-cps/). We will continue to report data from the ACS for 2021 and later. Estimates from the CPS are not comparable to estimates from ACS.,,

"The U.S. Census Bureau's poverty threshold for a family with two adults and one child was $21,811 in 2021.This is the official measurement of poverty used by the Federal Government, and the measure used for most poverty-based data presented on State Health Facts. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) produces simplified - but very similar - versions of these poverty thresholds called ""poverty guidelines"" that are used to assess eligibility for income-based programs such as Medicaid. For more information on measures of poverty, please see the detailed description provided by HHS: [http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/faq.cfm](http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/faq.cfm). For 2021 and historical thresholds, use [https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-poverty-thresholds.html).",,
